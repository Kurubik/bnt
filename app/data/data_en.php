You may terminate any line of Service prior to the end of the Term Commitment, provided however that if you do terminate prior to the Term Commitment, you will be required to pay an Early Termination Fee (“EFT”). The EFT is calculated by taking the number of months remaining on your Term Commitment and per Device and multiplying that number by $20. The maximum EFT for any early termination is $350 and the minimum is $200. Payment of an EFT does not satisfy any other obligation which you may owe to DIALOQ.

                'Calculation of Your Charges For Billing Purposes for Voice Calls. We round up partial minutes of use to the next full minute. Time starts when you press "Talk" or your Device connects to the network and stops when you press "End" or the network connection otherwise breaks. You are charged for all calls that connect, even to answering machines, voicemail, or voice transcription services. You will not be charged for calls under 3 seconds. For incoming calls answered, you are charged from the time shortly before the Device starts ringing until you press "End" or the network connection otherwise breaks. If charges vary depending on the time of day that you place or receive calls (for example, Nights and Weekend plans), you\'re charged for the entire call based on the rate that applies to the time period in which the call starts. ',
                'Data Usage: Unless we specifically tell you otherwise, data usage is measured in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes—not in minutes/time. 1024 bytes equals 1 kilobyte ("KB"), 1024 KB equals 1 megabyte, and 1024 megabytes equals 1 gigabyte. Bytes are rounded up to kilobytes, so you will be charged at least 1 KB for each data usage session ("data session"). Rounding occurs at the end of each data session, and sometimes during a data session. Depending on your data Services, usage may be charged against an allowance or on a fixed price per KB, and you may be subject to limitations on the amount of data usage. If you are charged on a fixed price per KB, any fractional cents will be rounded up to the next cent. You are charged for all data directed to your Device\'s internet address, including data sessions you did not initiate and for incomplete transfers. As long as your Device is connected to our data networks, you may incur data charges. Examples of data for which you will be charged includes the size of a requested file or Data Content (game, ringer, etc.); web page graphics (logos, pictures, banners, advertisement, etc.); additional data used in accessing, transporting, and routing the file on our network; data from partial or interrupted downloads; re-sent data; and data associated with unsuccessful attempts to reach websites or use applications. These data charges are in addition to any charges for the Data Content itself (game, ringer, etc.). Data used and charged to you will vary widely, even between identical actions or data sessions. Estimates of data usage—for example, the size of downloadable files—are not reliable predictors of actual usage. Your bill won\'t separately list the number of KB attributed to a specific action/data session. ',

It reflects monthly recurring charges (usually billed one bill cycle in advance), fees, taxes, Surcharges, product and equipment charges, subscription charges, and usage/transaction specific charges (usually billed in the bill cycle in which they are incurred). Some usage charges, such as those that depend on usage information from a third party, may be billed in subsequent bill cycles and result in higher than expected charges for that month. Bill cycles and dates may change from time to time.Your bill may also include other important notices (for example, changes to your Agreement, to your Service, legal notices, etc.).Your paper bill may not include itemized billing detail. More specific billing information is available online. Paper bills with itemized detail may be subject to an additional charge.

DIALOQ reserves the right to apply a late payment charge to the total unpaid balance of your bill (at the highest rate permitted by law) if you do not make payment in full by the date specified on your bill. We may also charge you any costs we pay to a collection agency to collect unpaid balances from you. If we bill you for amounts on behalf of a third party, payments received are first applied to our charges. You may be charged additional fees for certain methods of payment. We may charge you, up to the highest amount permitted by law, for returned checks or other payments paid by you and denied for any reason by a financial institution. Acceptance of payments (even if marked "paid in full") does not waive our right to collect all amounts that you owe us. We may restrict your payment methods to cashier\'s check, money order, or other similar secure form of payment at any time for good reason. You authorize regularly scheduled charges to your credit card once signed up for recurring billing. You will be charged the amount of the monthly charge of the plan(s) you have selected, plus overage. A receipt for each payment will be emailed to you and the charge will appear on your credit card statement as "Amtel" or "DIALOQ." In the event your projected usage/overage will be more then 100% of your monthly recurring charge, DIALOQ will charge the overage portion of the debt owed to the credit card you have provided before the end of the bill cycle.

                '911 or Other Emergency Calls. Public safety officials advise that when making 911 or other emergency calls, you should always be prepared to provide your location information.Unlike traditional wireline phones, depending on a number of factors (for example, whether your Device is GPS enabled, where you are, whether local emergency service providers have upgraded their equipment, etc.), 911 operators may not know your phone number, your location, or the location of your Device. In certain circumstances, an emergency call may be routed to a state patrol dispatcher or alternative location set by local emergency service providers. Enhanced 911 service ("E911") – where enabled by local emergency authorities – uses GPS technology to provide location information. Even when available, however, E911 does not always provide accurate location information. If your Device is indoors or for some other reason cannot acquire a satellite signal, you may not be located. Some Devices have a safety feature that prevents use of the keypad after dialing 911—you should follow voice prompts when interacting with emergency service providers employing interactive voice response systems to screen calls.
